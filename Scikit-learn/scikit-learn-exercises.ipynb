    "1. **R^2 (pronounced r-squared) or coefficient of determination** - Compares your models predictions to the mean of the targets. Values can range from negative infinity (a very poor model) to 1. For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, its R^2 value would be 0. And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1. \n",
